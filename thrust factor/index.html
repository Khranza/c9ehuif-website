                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        Thrust Factor is a tight, punishing, movement based space shooter roguelite, loosely based on the classic arcade game Asteroids. The player avoids lasers, missiles and space rocks while battling bosses and gathering upgrade modules to improve their ship.

                        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
                        I wanted to modernize the retro game Asteroids. Apart from sound and graphics, I set out to improve four aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modernized controls</li>
                            <li>Faster-paced and more active gameplay</li>
                            <li>Better enemy AI</li>
                            <li>More progression and better replayability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        I described the <u><b>core player experience</b></u> as high-risk, high-reward "glass cannon", demanding precision and rewarding mastery.

                        <h3>Player Controller</h3>
                        The first order of business was to establish the Three C's (Character, Camera, Controller) which each had to support the core player experience. <br><br>
                        One important decision was to make the player only able to shoot in the direction they are flying, forcing them to always face the danger, using the mouse cursor to rotate. <br><br>
                        <!-- To accommodate fast but controllable movement, the camera jumps in front of the player while boosting for a better forward view. <br><br> -->
                        While I noticed that this control scheme feels unusual at first, it enables very precise movement and, according to playtesters, a satisfyingly <u><b>high skill ceiling</b></u>.

                        <h3>Forcing Movement</h3>
                        After adding asteroids I noticed a problem: just like in classic Asteroids, players remained stationary, practically turning the game into a turret sim. 
                        <br><br>
                        Instead of bloating the game with new, unneccessary mechanics, I decided to work with the tools I had, and <b><u>design enemy AI</u></b> that forces the player to employ a more active playstyle.
                        <br><br>
                        Each one of the three basic enemies, as well as the asteroids themselves, play a specific role in getting the player moving.

                        There are three important gameplay loops at play. The addition of a meta loop, in this case buying permanent unlocks, was necesarry to give players concise and measureable goals to work towards in between runs.

                        The design pillars I established early on dictate Thrust Factor should be difficult and skill-based. The addition of permanent upgrades would clash with that idea. That's why unlocks do not simply make the player stronger: <br><br>Instead, they unlock new abilities, such as flares (defense against missiles), and their upgrade tree. It adds a layer of complexity and choice to the game.

                    <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                    Turning Asteroids into Thrust Factor was incredibly fun and rewarding. The project taught me a lot about systems design, in particular the interaction between different game loops. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I didn't expect that the biggest challenge would be to get players to move around more. Some players still preferred to play more passively, which frustrated me at first. But I realized that the game supporting multiple viable playstyles is actually a good thing, and trying to force every player into a specific playstyle is counterproductive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I haven't touched upon sound design and music, which in my opinion are definitely part of game design as well, and I could dedicate another entire page to. You can listen to the soundtrack <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeditor/sets/thrust-factor-original-soundtrack">here</a>.
