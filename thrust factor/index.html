                    Thrust Factor is a tight, difficult, movement based space shooter, loosely based on the classic game Asteroids. The player avoids lasers, missiles and asteroids while battling bosses and gathering upgrade blips to improve their ship.

                        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
                        I wanted to modernize the retro game Asteroids. Apart from sound and graphics, I set out to improve four aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modernized controls</li>
                            <li>Faster and more active gameplay</li>
                            <li>Better enemy AI</li>
                            <li>More long-term goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Controls</h3>
                        After multiple iterations, it turned out that in a top-down perspective, using the mouse to both aim and turn worked really well. It means you fire in the direction you're flying: the player will be pointed <b><u>towards</u></b> the danger.

                    <h3>Forcing Movement</h3>
                    Like in classic Asteroids, players initially remain stationary, turning the game into a turret sim. Instead of adding arbitrary mechanics, I decided to work with the tools I had, and design enemies that force the player to move.
                </div>

                <p>
                    Through playtesting I found that players got bored after a few runs: there was too little long-term progression. That's why I designed a meta loop: to sustain engagement, the player can buy permanent upgrades.
