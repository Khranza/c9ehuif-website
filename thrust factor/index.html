                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        Thrust Factor is a tight, difficult, movement based space shooter roguelite, loosely based on the classic arcade game Asteroids. The player avoids lasers, missiles and space rocks while battling bosses and gathering upgrade modules to improve their ship.

                        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
                        I wanted to modernize the retro game Asteroids. Apart from sound and graphics, I set out to improve four aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modernized controls</li>
                            <li>Faster-paced and more active gameplay</li>
                            <li>Better enemy AI</li>
                            <li>More long-term goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Controls</h3>
                        After multiple iterations, it turned out that using the mouse to both aim and rotate worked really well. It means you fire in the direction you're flying: the player will be pointed <b><u>towards</u></b> the danger. <br><br> This control scheme has a steep learning curve, but allows for very precise movement, lending to a <b><u>high skill ceiling</u></b>.

                        <h3>Forcing Movement</h3>
                        There was a problem: just like in classic Asteroids, players initially remained stationary, turning the game into a turret sim. 
                        <br><br>
                        Instead of bloating the game with new, unneccessary mechanics, I decided to work with the tools I had, and <b><u>design enemy AI</u></b> that forces the player to employ a more active playstyle.
                        <br><br>
                        Each one of the three basic enemies, as well as the asteroids themselves, play a specific role in getting the player moving.

                        My goal was to create a map without obtrusive boundries. Inspired by the "Blue Sphere" levels of Sonic Mania, I implemented a loop-around mechanic. If an object is too far out of view, it loops back to the other side. Not a single playtester ever noticed! <br><br>Funny enough, in hindsight this brings it closer to classic Asteroids.

                        There are three important gameplay loops at play. The addition of a meta loop, in this case buying permanent unlocks, was necesarry to give players concise and measureable goals to work towards in between runs.

                        One of my design pillars was that Thrust Factor should be difficult and skill-based. The addition of permanent upgrades would clash with that idea. That's why unlocks do not simply make the player stronger: <br><br>Instead, they unlock new abilities, such as flares (defense against missiles), and their upgrade tree. It adds a layer of complexity and choice to the game.

                    <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
                    Turning Asteroids into Thrust Factor was incredibly fun and rewarding. The project taught me a lot about system design in general, but especially about the interaction between different game loops. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I didn't expect that the biggest challenge would be to get players to move around more. Some players still preferred to play more passively, which frustrated me at first. But I realized that the game supporting multiple viable playstyles is actually a good thing, and trying to force every player into a specific playstyle is counterproductive.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I haven't touched upon sound design and music, which in my opinion are definitely part of game design as well, and I could dedicate another entire page to. You can listen to the soundtrack <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jeditor/sets/thrust-factor-original-soundtrack">here</a>.
