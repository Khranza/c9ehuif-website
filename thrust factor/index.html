                    Thrust Factor is a tight, difficult, movement based space shooter roguelite, loosely based on the classic arcade game Asteroids. The player avoids lasers, missiles and space rocks while battling bosses and gathering upgrade modules to improve their ship.

                        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
                        I wanted to modernize the retro game Asteroids. Apart from sound and graphics, I set out to improve four aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modernized controls</li>
                            <li>Faster-paced and more active gameplay</li>
                            <li>Better enemy AI</li>
                            <li>More long-term goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        After multiple iterations, it turned out that using the mouse to both aim and rotate worked really well. It means you fire in the direction you're flying: the player will be pointed <b><u>towards</u></b> the danger. <br><br> This control scheme has a steep learning curve, but allows for very precise movement, lending to a <b><u>high skill ceiling</u></b>.

                        Enemies and asteroids drop upgrade blips when destroyed. This invites players to actively move around in the level. When enough blips are gathered, the player can, when it suits them, enter the upgrade screen.

                        Instead of health being a continuous scale, and damage being some arbitrary value, I opted for a tighter system with lower numbers: you have 3 health points, and the player deals 1 damage every time. 
                        <br><br>This system rewards precision, punishes carelessness, and is much easier to communicate!

                        There was a problem: just like in classic Asteroids, players initially remained stationary, turning the game into a turret sim. 
                        <br><br>
                        Instead of bloating the game with new, unneccessary mechanics, I decided to work with the tools I had, and <b><u>design enemy AI</u></b> that forces the player to employ a more active playstyle.
                        <br><br>
                        Each one of the three basic enemies, as well as the asteroids themselves, play a specific role in getting the player moving.

                        Through playtesting I found that players got bored after a few runs: there was too little long-term progression. That's why I designed a meta loop. 
                        <br><br> 
                        The player earns tokens by surviving, killing enemies and defeating bosses. These tokens can be used to buy permanent upgrades in between rounds. This helps sustain engagement, as it gives players constant visible, measurable progression.

                        One of my design pillars was that Thrust Factor should be a difficult, skill-based game. The addition of permanent upgrades would clash with that idea. That's why permanent unlocks do not make the player stronger. <br><br>Instead, they unlock new abilities, such as flares (defense against missiles), and their upgrade tree. It adds a layer of complexity and choice to the game.

                    <br>
                    Some players still preferred to play more passively, which is fine. I realized that the game supporting multiple viable playstyles is a good thing, and trying to force every player into a specific playstyle is counterproductive.
