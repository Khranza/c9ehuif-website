                    Thrust Factor is a tight, difficult, movement based space shooter roguelite, loosely based on the classic game Asteroids. The player avoids lasers, missiles and asteroids while battling bosses and gathering upgrade blips to improve their ship.

                        <h3>Design Goal</h3>
                        I wanted to modernize the retro game Asteroids. Apart from sound and graphics, I set out to improve four aspects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Modernized controls</li>
                            <li>Faster-paced and more active gameplay</li>
                            <li>Better enemy AI</li>
                            <li>More long-term goals</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                        <h3>Controls</h3>
                        After multiple iterations, it turned out that using the mouse to both aim and rotate worked really well. It means you fire in the direction you're flying: the player will be pointed <b><u>towards</u></b> the danger. <br><br> This control scheme has a steep learning curve, but allows for very precise movement, lending to a <b><u>high skill ceiling</u></b>.

                        <h3>Forcing Movement</h3>
                        There was a problem: just like in classic Asteroids, players initially remained stationary, turning the game into a turret sim. Instead of adding arbitrary mechanics, I decided to work with the tools I had, and design enemies that force the player employ a more active playstyle.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Through playtesting I found that players got bored after a few runs: there was too little long-term progression. That's why I designed a meta loop: to sustain engagement, the player can buy permanent upgrades.
