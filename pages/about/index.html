            <h3>Game designer & generalist</h3>
            Hoi, my name is Nathan! Currently studying Game Design at HKU in the Netherlands, I've been designing and developing games from a young age. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Though my journey started off with trying to create experiences akin to my favourite games at the time, my interest has veered away from pure entertainment, in favor of more experimental and unconventional games.
            <br>
            <br>
            For me, one of the most rewarding feelings is surprising players with how fun and refreshing experimental games can be. Such was the case with my 2025 study project "Virtual Encounters".
            <br>
            <br>
            Though this is not a hard rule I've set for myself; I'm perfectly capable of designing more conventional games too; see "Thrust Factor."
