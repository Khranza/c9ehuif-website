            Hoi, my name is Nathan! I've been designing and developing games from a young age, and now I'm persuing my passion as a Game Design student at HKU. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Though my journey started off with trying to create experiences akin to my favourite games at the time, my interest has veered away from pure entertainment, in favor of more experimental and unconventional games.
            <br>
            <br>
            For me, one of the most rewarding feelings is surprising players with how fun and refreshing experimental games can be. Such was the case with my 2025 end-year project "Virtual Encounters".
            <br>
            <br>
            Though this is not a hard rule I've set for myself; I enjoy designing more conventional games too. See "Thrust Factor."
